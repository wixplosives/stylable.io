In the [Import Class chapter](./import.mdx), we saw how we can import CSS classes and target them by composing a selector to target our desired parts.

In this chapter, we'll see how to extend a stylesheet to target inner parts and states.

**Current status:**

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css title="player.st.css"
.root {
  -st-states: registered,
              ranking(enum(first, second, third));
}
.avatar {}
.username {}
```

```css title="game.st.css"
@st-import Player, [avatar, username] from "./player.st.css";

Player {
  background: blue;
}
Player .avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
Player .username {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Previously, we manually customized the `Player` component by creating a selector that includes a descendant combinator between the `Player` and our targeted parts. This selector is based on knowledge we have about the `Player` component structure, but this structure might change in the future, and break our assumptions.

## Extend a stylesheet

To help us abstract our selector, we'll extend the `Player` stylesheet to gain access to the stylesheet API, letting us target inner parts using [custom pseudo-elements](../../references/pseudo-elements.md).

We'll first set the `-st-extends` property with the value of the imported `Player` stylesheet on the local `player` class.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css title="game.st.css"
@st-import Player from "./player.st.css";

.player {
    -st-extends: Player;
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Namespacing output</summary>
  <CodeBlock title="game.st.css" language="css">
    {`@st-import Player from "./player.st.css";
  
/* customizing class, local namespace */
.game__player {
    -st-extends: Player;
}`}
  </CodeBlock>
</details>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

We [previously saw](./import.mdx#stylesheet-root-selector) that we can't simply target an imported stylesheet, as that would affect all instances of it.

Here, by using the `-st-extends` property on a local class, we are scoping these customizations to the subtree of our component stylesheet.

### Apply the extending class

To customize a `Player` component instance using our local stylesheet, we will need to apply the extending local class to the instance of the component.

```jsx
import Player from './player.jsx';
import { st, classes } from './game.st.css';

const Game = ({ className }) => (
  <div className={st(classes.root, className)}>
    <Player className={classes.player} />
  </div>
);
```

### Access inner parts

We can now use the custom pseudo-element syntax to safely target the `avatar` and `username` parts of the `Player` component.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css title="game.st.css"
@st-import Player from "./player.st.css";

.player {
  -st-extends: Player;
}
.player::avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
.player::username {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Namespacing output</summary>
  <CodeBlock title="game.st.css" language="css">
    {`@st-import Player from "./player.st.css";
  
.game__player {
  -st-extends: Player;
}
.game__player .player__avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
.game__player .player__username {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}`}
  </CodeBlock>
</details>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Access a state

Similar to how we used custom pseudo-elements to access inner parts of a component externally, we can now target custom pseudo-classes (states) of our extended part as well.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css title="game.st.css"
@st-import Player from "./player.st.css";

.player {
  -st-extends: Player;
}
.player:ranking(first) {
  background: gold;
}
/* ... */
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Extend multiple levels

Let's say that we want to turn our current `avatar` part, into a component to support a more complex design with separate elements for the `frame` and the `image`.

### Another example, this time quick

To do this, we'll create a new `avatar.st.css` stylesheet, import it to `player.st.css`, and extend our `avatar` class with it.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css title="avatar.st.css"
.root {}
.frame {}
.image {}
```

```css title="player.st.css"
@st-import Avatar from "./avatar.st.css";

.root {
  -st-states: registered, 
              ranking(enum(first, second, third));
}
.avatar {
  -st-extends: Avatar;
}
.username {}
```

By extending a stylesheet, which in turn has a part that extends a stylesheet, we can target inner parts through multiple levels with code completion and validations.

```css title="game.st.css"
@st-import Player from "./player.st.css";

.player {
  -st-extends: Player;
}

/* all player instances have an avatar with a green frame*/
.player::avatar::frame {
  background: green;
}

/* the player in the first ranking, has an avatar with a golden frame */
.player:ranking(first)::avatar::frame {
  background: gold;
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

:::tip Catch breaking changes
Let's imagine a case, where the `Avatar` component has undergone refactoring which changed the part name `frame` to `box`. If we were using native CSS, and were aware of this change, we could try and manually locate all instances of `frame` and replace them with `box`. But if we were to miss an instance, CSS would provide no indication of the problem.

Because we used Stylable to declare that a class extends a stylesheet, and access its inner parts, we are assured that the interface exists and is valid, and if this interface were to change, an error would be reported at build-time and in the IDE.

In this chapter we saw how once we extend a stylesheet, we can target inner parts and states using native-like syntax, while benefiting from language service features and diagnostics.

Next we'll start talking about features that have to do with style templating, beginning with variables, both native custom properties, and Stylable's build-time variables.
