Stylable requires `*.st.css` stylesheets to be imported into your `*.ts/*.tsx` files for class names, states, variables, or keyframes to be applied to your components.

By default, TypeScript has no way of knowing what a `*.st.css` file contains, and so you must define a type for it.

Below, we describe two **complementing** ways of doing so.

## 1. Declaring global stylesheet typings

The first type definition you should include in your project is a general purpose `*.st.css` global declaration. This provides a broad signature of a Stylable stylesheet.

To do this, create a `globals.d.ts` file in your `./src` directory and add the following declaration:

```ts
// globals.d.ts
declare module "*.st.css" {
  export * from "@stylable/runtime/stylesheet";

  const defaultExport: unknown;
  export default defaultExport;
}
```

## 2. Generating stylesheet definition files

Stylable provides the ability to generate type definition files (`.d.ts`) for any stylesheet. These serve as static typings for each export that the stylesheet provides:

- `class`/`var`/`stVar`/`keyframe` - exposes available symbols defined within the stylesheet
- `st`/`style`/`cssStates` - exposes stylesheet utility functions typed according to states defined within stylesheet

These files are generated by using our `@stylable/cli`:

```sh
stc --dts
```

:::note
If you are consuming stylesheets that do not have `.d.ts` files, the global type definition will serve as a fallback type.
:::

### Generating source-maps

In addition to generating `.d.ts` files, you can also generate source-maps (`.d.ts.map`).

These source-maps will map the content of the `.d.ts` file back to the source stylesheet (`.st.css`) so that you can jump to definitions in your stylesheets straight from your TypeScript files.

```sh
stc --dts --dtsSourceMap
```

### Development mode

To have a good experience when working locally in dev mode, we recommend generating both the definition files and their source-maps using our `watch` service.

This ensures that as you are working your code, validations, completions and other language-service capabilities will remain up-to-date.

```sh
stc --dts --dtsSourceMap -w --cjs false
```

:::tip
Generating both definition and source-map files for every stylesheet in your project can make the project seem more cluttered.

To help ease this, we recommend adding the generated `*.st.css.d.ts` and `*.st.css.d.ts.map` files to your `.gitignore` file and only including them in your published packages.
:::

### Publishing

If you publish any `*.st.css` in your package, you should also publish the `.d.ts` and `.d.ts.map` files alongside them. This will result in a better experience for users consuming your project.

```sh
stc --outDir="dist" --stcss --dts --dtsSourceMap
```

### ESlint Stylable plugin vs. generated definition files

There is an overlap of functionality between the Stylable ESlint plugin and the generated `.d.ts` files.

Both of these solutions will validate stylesheet export usages. However the `.d.ts` file approach is probably the better one. It offers better validations, completions and correctness. It does require the `watch` service to be running.

So, if you are generating definition files, you can remove the ESlint Stylable plugin and suffer no degredation in development experience.
