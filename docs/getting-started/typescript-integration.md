Stylable requires `*.st.css` stylesheets to be imported into your `*.ts/*.tsx` files for class names, states, variables, or keyframes to be applied to your components.

By default, TypeScript has no way of knowing whatâ€™s inside a `*.st.css` file, so you must define a type for it.
To help ease this requirement, Stylable can generate a declaration file for each stylesheet. These files are generated using our [`@stylable/cli`](https://github.com/wix/stylable/tree/master/packages/cli) or by using it through one of our integrations.

Using `create-stylable-app` will generate the `.d.ts` files when running:

```sh
npm start
```

or when building the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

:::tip
All of the examples below are showing the flow of running our `stc` CLI.
Alternatively, you can use the `stylable.config.js` file to have it generated for you. See further information [here](https://github.com/wix/stylable/tree/master/packages/cli#configuration-file).
:::

## Publishing

If you publish any `*.st.css` files in your package, you should also publish the `.d.ts` and `.d.ts.map` files alongside them. This practice leads to a better experience for users consuming your project.

```sh
stc --outDir="dist" --stcss --dts --dtsSourceMap
```

## Manually generating stylesheet definition files

Stylable provides the ability to generate type definition files (`.d.ts`) for any stylesheet. These serve as static typings for each export that the [stylesheet runtime](../references/runtime.md) provides.

Generate a `.d.ts` next to all `*.st.css` files:

```sh
stc --dts
```

Alternatively, you can generate the `.d.ts` files to a custom folder, for example, `st-types`:

```sh
stc --srcDir="src" --outDir="st-types" --dts
```

Then modify your `tsconfig.json` to specify two `rootDirs`, your source files, and the generated typings (learn more about this by reading the [`tsconfig.json` documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#rootDirs)):

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDirs": ["./src", "./st-types"]
  }
}
```

### Import third-party stylesheets that do not provide `.d.ts` files

You will have to [declare global typings](#declaring-global-stylesheet-typings), but to keep it type safe you should update the request to match the module's stylesheets only.

For example:

```ts
/* globals.d.ts: */
declare module 'third-party-package/*.st.css' {
  export * from '@stylable/runtime/stylesheet';

  const defaultExport: unknown;
  export default defaultExport;
}
```

### Generating source-maps

In addition to generating `.d.ts` files, you can also generate source-maps (`.d.ts.map`).

These source-maps will map the content of the `.d.ts` file back to the source stylesheet (`.st.css`) so that you can jump to definitions in your stylesheets straight from your TypeScript files.

```sh
stc --dts --dtsSourceMap
```

:::note
Source maps are generated by default when generating `.d.ts` files. If these are not wanted, the `--dtsSourceMap` flag should be set to `false`.
:::

### Development mode

To have a good experience when working locally in dev mode, we recommend generating both the definition files and their source-maps using our `watch` service.

This ensures that as you are working your code, validations, completions and other language-service capabilities will remain up-to-date.

```sh
stc --dts --dtsSourceMap -w
```

:::tip
Generating both definition and source-map files for every stylesheet in a project can clutter the project up. For this reason, we recommend adding the generated `*.st.css.d.ts` and `*.st.css.d.ts.map` files to your `.gitignore` file, and only include them in your published packages.
:::

### ESlint Stylable plugin vs. generated definition files

There is an overlap of functionality between the Stylable ESlint plugin and the generated `.d.ts` files - both solutions validate stylesheet export usages. The `.d.ts` file approach is superior, howevever, as it offers better validations, completions and correctness. All it requires is that the `watch` service be running.

In conclusion, if you are generating definition files, you can remove the ESlint Stylable plugin and suffer no degredation in development experience.

## Declaring global stylesheet typings

If you choose not to generate `.d.ts` typings for each stylesheet, then it is required that you include in your project a general purpose `*.st.css` global declaration. This provides a broad signature of a Stylable stylesheet.

To do this, create a `globals.d.ts` file in your `./src` directory and add the following declaration:

```ts
/* globals.d.ts: */
declare module '*.st.css' {
  export * from '@stylable/runtime/stylesheet';

  const defaultExport: unknown;
  export default defaultExport;
}
```
