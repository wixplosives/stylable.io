## First time hearing about Stylable?

No worries! Stylable is a tool that empowers you to create safe, reusable style APIs for your components. It's a superset of CSS that adds a type-system to it, providing type-safety, and powerful language capabilities.

Want to learn more? We recently started writing a [new handbook](/docs/guides/handbook/intro) to help get you up to speed, and more content is on its way over the coming weeks.

## What went on behind the scenes?

Over the last couple of years, we focused on developing Stylable internally in Wix, building it into an entire tooling ecosystem.

We integrated Stylable across Wix.com, both for internal tools and user-facing components. We stress-tested the project making sure it meets our requirements. Today, Stylable helps power over 50 million user websites, and is the de facto styling solution for new projects and new user-facing components.

## What have we been up to recently?

We recently released [Stylable v5](https://github.com/wix/stylable/releases/tag/v5.0.0), and we're excited to share it with the community.

Version 5 includes considerable refactoring and clean up of the Stylable core package to make it more robust, and its programmatic API more accessible.

If you encounter any bugs or issues, please open an issue on our [Github repository](https://github.com/wix/stylable/issues).

### Additional highlights

- We added a [new playground](https://stylable.io/playground) to help developers learn and experiment with Stylable.
- With monorepo projects becoming more and more common, we've been making an effort to improve how Stylable and our CLI handle them.
- Lastly, we've been focused on refining and expanding our documentation. Adding new guides, refactoring our API reference to a standard format, and improving the reading experience overall.

## What's next for Stylable?

Many new features are planned for Stylable, including the expansion of the type system to cover even more of CSS, and to create new integrations for emerging tools and technologies.

CSS as a language is rapidly progressing in recent years, with functionality increasing as the language expands. We're following the language closely as its specs progress, and we'll focus our efforts so that Stylable continues to offer the best possible experience over CSS at any time.

Although it's always been open-source, we feel like this is the time for us to introduce Stylable back to the web development community, and to hopefully show people how Stylable can make their development experience better. In the coming weeks, we'll be expanding our guides, examples, and documentation to make it even easier to onboard new users.
