## First time hearing about Stylable?

No worries! Stylable is a superset of CSS. It's a preprocessor that adds a type system to your CSS, and empowers you to create safe, reusable style APIs for your components.

Want to learn more? We have recently started writing a [new handbook](/docs/guides/handbook/intro) to help get you up to speed, with more content on the way over the coming weeks.

## What went on behind the scenes?

Over the last couple of years, we focused on developing Stylable as a preprocessor, building it into an entire tooling ecosystem.

We integrated Stylable across Wix.com, dogfooding the project and making sure it meets our requirements. In Wix, Stylable helps power over 50 million user websites, and is the de facto in-house styling solution for new projects.

## What have we been up to recently?

We just released [Stylable v5](https://github.com/wix/stylable/releases/tag/v5.0.0), and we're excited to share it with the community.

Version 5 includes considerable refactoring and clean up of the Stylable core package to make it more robust, and its programmatic API more accessible.

We also added a [new playground](https://stylable.io/playground) to help developers learn and experiment with Stylable.

With monorepo projects becoming more and more common, we've been making an effort to improve how Stylable and our CLI handle them.

## What's next for Stylable?

The CSS language has been rapidly progressing in recent years, with functionality increasing as the language expands. We're following the language as its specs progress, and we'll focus our efforts so that Stylable continues to offer the best possible experience over CSS at any time.

Many new features are planned for Stylable, including the expansion of the type system to cover even more of CSS, and to create new integrations for emerging tools and technologies.

We feel like this is the time for us to introduce Stylable to the web development community, and to hopefully show people how Stylable can make their development experience better. In the coming weeks, we'll be expanding our guides, examples, and documentation to make it even easier to onboard new users.

See our on-going development on [Github](https://github.com/wix/stylable), follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stylableio), and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/C5ZhENSbV7) where we're always up for a chat about styling.

We hope you'll join us in this journey, and we're looking forward to hearing your feedback.
