                            CSS. Its simple, declarative syntax that is native in browsers is easily the fastest way to
                            add styles to web pages and web apps. But when writing CSS that is scoped to individual
                            components, developers have to maintain highly-specific selectors, using elaborate
                            conventions to fake namespacing. Writing and maintaining CSS across large teams and large
                            projects can be tricky.

                            We also <span className={classes.heart}>&hearts;</span> TypeScript. TypeScript helps us
                            manage these large projects, exposing at build-time what we could once only see at run-time.
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            We want to give CSS a <em>type system</em> &mdash; to do for CSS what TypeScript does for
                            JavaScript.

                        So we created <strong>Stylable</strong> &mdash; a CSS preprocessor that enables you to write
                        style rules in CSS syntax, with some extensions that we believe adhere to the spirit of CSS.

                        <h2>What Does Stylable Do?</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Stylable scopes styles to components so they donâ€™t "leak" and clash with other styles.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Stylable enables custom pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements that abstract the internal
                                state and structure of a component. These can then be styled externally. For example,
                                you can style the label inside a button, or style the play button of a video player from
                                outside these components.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                At build time, the preprocessor converts the Stylable CSS into flat, static, valid,
                                vanilla CSS that works cross-browser.
                            </li>
